Additional components:

Load Balancer Cluster: Two HAproxy instances working together
Separate Web Server: Dedicated to handling HTTP requests
Separate Application Server: Focused on application logic
Separate Database Server: Dedicated to data management

Explanation points:

Additional server allows component separation for better performance and security
Load balancer cluster provides redundancy and high availability
Separating components allows for specialization and targeted scaling
Each server can be optimized for its specific role (I/O for web server, CPU for application, etc.)
