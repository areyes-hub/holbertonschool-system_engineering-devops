Additional components:

Firewalls: Three firewalls to control and filter traffic
SSL Certificate: For HTTPS encryption
Monitoring Clients: On each server, reporting to a monitoring service

Explanation points:

Firewalls protect servers by filtering traffic based on security rules
HTTPS encrypts data in transit between user and server for security
Monitoring collects metrics on performance, availability, and security
Monitoring tools collect data through agents/clients on each server
To monitor web server QPS (Queries Per Second), set up specific metrics for HTTP request counts

Issues:

SSL termination at load balancer exposes decrypted data within the internal network
Single Primary database is still a bottleneck for write operations
Uniform components on all servers prevent optimizing resources for specific functions
