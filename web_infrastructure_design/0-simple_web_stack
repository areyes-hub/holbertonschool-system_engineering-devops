Components:

User: Makes HTTP requests to the website using www.foobar.com
DNS System: Resolves www.foobar.com to the server IP (8.8.8.8)
Server: Contains all components of the web stack
Nginx: Web server that handles HTTP requests
Application Server: Processes dynamic content and business logic
Application Files: Your code base
MySQL Database: Stores and manages data

Explanation points:

A server is a physical or virtual machine that hosts services and applications
The domain name (foobar.com) provides a human-readable way to access the server
The 'www' in www.foobar.com is a CNAME or A record in DNS pointing to the server IP
The web server (Nginx) handles HTTP requests, serves static content
The application server executes application code and processes dynamic requests
The database stores and manages persistent data for the application
Communication happens over HTTP protocol between user's computer and server

Issues:

Single Point of Failure (SPOF): If the server goes down, the website is inaccessible
Downtime during maintenance: Any updates require taking the service offline
Limited scalability: Cannot handle high traffic volumes effectively
