Additional components:

Load Balancer (HAproxy): Distributes traffic between servers
Server 1 & Server 2: Each containing web server, application server, and code base
Database Cluster: Primary-Replica setup

Explanation points:

Load balancer is added to distribute traffic and prevent server overload
HAproxy can be configured with algorithms like Round Robin (evenly distributes), Least Connection (sends to least busy server), or IP Hash (consistency for returning users)
This setup can be Active-Active (both servers always handling traffic) or Active-Passive (one server on standby)
Database Primary-Replica cluster: Primary handles writes, Replica handles reads and serves as backup
Primary node processes write operations ensuring data consistency; Replica gets copies of data changes

Issues:

SPOF still exists in the load balancer
Security concerns: No firewall or HTTPS encryption
No monitoring system to track performance and issues
